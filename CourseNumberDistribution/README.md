This code will be for a website to distribute course permission numbers to verified UML students only.
Each student will only be able to claim one permission number for a course at a time. 
The site will verify that the number it is distributing to the student has not been previously distributed within the last 24 hours AND has not already been used in the SiS system.
The page that contains the students permission number will also expire 24 hours after issuance to allow other students a chance to register with that number if the first student fails to do so in that timeframe.
